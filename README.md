# Welcome to QuestForge

### What is QuestForge?

QuestForge is a small side project I’m building to learn full stack patterns by making productivity feel like an RPG. You complete tasks to earn XP and level up. I’m using this to practice real world flows (auth, CRUD, API design, DB schema, basic deployment).

### Why I’m building this

Sticking to a habit was always hard work for me. I needed something to push me to achieve my goals. A game that makes me stronger through completing my habits was the perfect answer. I love video games and incorporating that into my life was the solution.
